# Klosy Legacy
Klosy (Legacy) is a lightweight operating system. I created this repo only because it's safe to store the source code on GitHub, not on my computer.
**Warning:** Klosy (Legacy) is in developement and it isn't ready for downloading.
**Notice:** some code was taken from https://gitlab.com/sortie/meaty-skeleton. To get more information see http://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton

## NOTICE
This OS was recently renamed to Klosy Legacy because I want [Klosy Reloaded](https://github.com/kodo-pp/klosy-reloaded) to be referred as *Klosy*

This is a legacy version of Klosy. This project is discontinued now. For current version see [Klosy Reloaded](https://github.com/kodo-pp/klosy-reloaded)
